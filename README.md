# ForzaTelemetry
Basic API for logging telemetry data from Forza Horizon 5

So the FH5 game seems to have some pretty realistic physics and I wanted to see how the elipse of friction varies after tuning the cars.
I looked for a simple way to log the data out into an excel ".xlsx" file, but I couldn't find any, so... there it is.
Just python, you don't need to install anything besides some python modules and you are good to go.

I am no expert at programming so it is what it is.
It works, so who cares...

You will need to install:
Openpyxl - pip install openpyxl
