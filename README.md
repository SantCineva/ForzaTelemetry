So the FH5 game seems to have some pretty realistic physics and I wanted to see how the elipse of friction varies after tuning the cars.
I looked for a simple way to log the data out into an excel ".xlsx" file, but I couldn't find any, so... there it is.
Just python, you don't need to install anything besides some python modules and you are good to go.

I'm no expert at programming so it is what it is.
It works, so who cares...

You will need to install:
Openpyxl - pip install openpyxl
